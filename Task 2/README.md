# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions
## Overview
This repository offers an implementation of a credit card fraud detection system employing Random Forest in conjunction with various sampling techniques, including undersampling, oversampling, and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), accompanied by visualization for enhanced analysis. Random Forest is chosen for its effectiveness in handling imbalanced datasets typical in fraud detection scenarios. By integrating undersampling, oversampling, and SMOTE, the system addresses class imbalance, ensuring the model learns from both fraudulent and non-fraudulent instances adequately. Visualizations aid in understanding the distribution of fraudulent instances, feature importance, and model performance metrics, providing insights crucial for optimizing fraud detection accuracy. This comprehensive approach offers a robust solution for detecting and mitigating credit card fraud, crucial for safeguarding financial transactions.
